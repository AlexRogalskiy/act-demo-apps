# Actframework Job demo

This sample project demonstrates how to schedule backend jobs in actframework

There are two ways to run the app:

* Run `demo.jobs.JobApp` directly in your IDE (you have to import the project as maven project) into your IDE
* type `mvn clean compile exec:exec` in the project dir
